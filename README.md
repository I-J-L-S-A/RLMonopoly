 RLMonopoly
=================

RLMonopoly is a Reinforcement Learning library for the famous board game Monopoly. It is developed in .NET 3.5 using C#.
In this version (alpha) the environment and the agent are fully functional but the GUI is not actively bound to the procedures running in the background.
